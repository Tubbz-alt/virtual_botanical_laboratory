# Virtual Botanical Laboratory

A while back I started reading [Prusinkiewicz and Lindenmayer (1990).The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants](algorithmicbotany.org/papers/abop/abop.pdf) (pdf). It uses countless examples and refers to "virtual botanical laboratory" software for exploring these examples. Building on the theoretical ideas in the first chapter, I wrote my own virtual botanical laboratory as a way to read the book in a constructionist way.
